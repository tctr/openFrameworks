### What is this repo and branch Android_fixes_thierry ?

This is a fork of **Dan Rosser (@danoli3)** own fork of openFrameworks [https://github.com/danoli3/openFrameworks](https://github.com/danoli3/openFrameworks) that I've used to experiment with OF on Android with **modern Android tools**. Dan has indeed rearchitectured the way the OF build for Android can be done.

Default branch is **Android_fixes_thierry**, starting from Dan's **Android_fixes**.

I added :
- a few corrections and completions
- a composite example under (examples/Android) which works on my Android phone 
- the binaries of the initial libs used by OF (boost, freeimage, openCV...)

I have added these binaries for convenience because current **download_libs.sh** under **scripts/android** does not fully work and I had to manually include some the binaries in the right places with the right names. That will need to be fixed.


### Building openFrameworks Android lib and composite example

The composite example includes `ofShaderExample` `ofSoundPlayerExample` `ofSoundStreamExample`. It was constructed starting by **manually copying** the following project : **scripts/template/android** under example/android. **ProjectGenerator was not used.**

To make a build, start by **building the openFrameworks lib** for Android by :
- opening the following project in Android Studio : **libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project/android**
- gradle starts to configure the project
- launch **Build / make module android.openframeworksAndroid**
- if gradle stops asking for another version of Gradle JDK do as stated below and sync
- rebuild
- **libopenFrameworksAndroid.so binaries** are created for **arm64-v8a  -  armeabi-v7a  -  x86** in **libs/openFrameworksCompiled/lib/android**

Changing the version of the Gradle JDK : in **Settings / Build, Execution, Deployment / Build Tools / Gradle** (I use the JetBrains 17.0.6 version).

It is then possible to build the example and generate the corresponding APK / bundle by :
- opening  **examples/android/androidCompositeExample** in Android Studio
- in the Android view : select **build / make module androidCompositeExample.ofApp** 
- then launch **build / build bundle / apk / your choice** to **generate an apk or a bundle** in **ofApp/build/output**
- with a connected device you can upload and lauch the app

### Additional examples : how to
To build additional examples modify with your destination directory and launch the following file : `./scripts/android/create_hierarchy_emptyExample.sh`

This creates the file hierarchy needed to build Android example using CMake and Android Studio.

Then :
- replace the app files `ofApp.h` `ofApp.cpp` eventually `main.cpp`
- change the name of the app in `ofApp/src/amin/res/values*/strings.xml`
- change the application ID in `ofApp/build.gradle` => example :
 ```  
 defaultConfig {
        applicationId "cc.openframeworks.androidCameraExample"  // IMPORTANT : THIS DEFINES THE ID OF THE APK
```
- change android permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Add additional include and cpp files in `CMakeLists.txt` as well as links to additional lib binaries if necessary (see `androidOfxSoundObject` example)
- in `androidOfxSoundObject` example, I had to link to GLES1 instead of GLES2 in `CMakeLists.txt`
- change Java activity if necessary

### Built and tested examples so far as of today (2024/06/20)
- `androidEmptyExample`
- `androidCompositeExample` : mixes `androidShaderExample` `androidSoundPlayerExample` `androidSoundStreamExample`
- `androidCameraExample`
- `androidOfxSoundObject` with `ofxSoundObjects` addon
- `androidOpenCVExample`
- `androidOpenCVFaceExample`


### Special case : ofxOpenCv examples

For `ofxOpenCv` I created an Android Studio project in addons/ofxOpenCv/android which generates a `libofxOpenCVAndroid.so` lib in `addons/ofxOpenCv/libs/android` for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`. This project replicates the solution that **Dan @danoli3** uses to generate the `libopenFrameworksAndroid.so`

`libofxOpenCVAndroid.so` can be linked in all openCV examples without recompiling it each time.

In CMake I don't use the `find_package(OPENCV)` instructions but build straight from the opencv lib folders under `ofxOpenCv`. I generated the libs using apocathery. Here is a small howto for those interested [building_opencv_for_android](./Docs/building_opencv_for_android.md).

### Tests and Play Store
- The version of Android Studio that I have used is **Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1 Patch 1**

- That was tested on a Xiaomi MI lite 10 from 2020, runnning **Android 10, SDK 29**.

- I managed to **upload a demo app** for internal testing on the **Play Store** `com.tctr.marscollege`. I still have **one last accessibility warning**, but that's the only one. App is doing ok on different kind of devices.

## folder structure

This release of OF comes with several folders:

* addons
* apps
* docs
* examples
* export (on some systems)
* libs
* other
* scripts
* projectGenerator


`docs` has some documentation around OF usage, per platform things to consider, etc. You should definitely take a look in there; for example, if you are on OSX, read the osx.md.   `apps` and `examples` are where projects go -- `examples` contains a variety of projects that show you how to use OF, and `apps` is where your own projects will go.  `libs` contains the libraries that OF uses, including the openframeworks core itself.  `addons` are for additional functionality that's not part of the core.  `export` is for DLLs and dylibs that need to be put in each compiled project.  The `scripts` folder has the templates and small scripts for automating OF per platform. `project generator` is a GUI based tool for making new projects - this folder is only there in packaged releases.  

One idea that's important is that OF releases are designed to be self-contained.  You can put them anywhere on your hard drive, but it's not possible to mix different releases of OF together, so please keep each release (0.8.0, 0.8.1) separate.  Projects may generally work from release to release, but this is not guaranteed.  Because OF is self-contained, there's extensive use of local file paths (ie, ../../../) throughout OF.  It's important to be aware of how directories are structured.  A common error is to take a project and move it so that it's a level below or above where it used to be compared to the root of OF.  This means that links such as ../../../libs will break.  

## Get involved

The openframeworks forum:

[http://forum.openframeworks.cc/](http://forum.openframeworks.cc/)

is a warm and friendly place.  Please ask or answer a question.  The most important part of this project is that it's a community, more than just a tool, so please join us!  Also, this is free software, and we learn so much about what is hard, what doesn't make sense, what is useful, etc. The most basic questions are acceptable here!  Don't worry, just join the conversation.  Learning in OF is social, it's hard to do it alone, but together we can get far!

## Developers

To grab a copy of openFrameworks for your platform, check the [download page](http://openframeworks.cc/download) on the main site.  

If you are working with the Git repository, the `stable` branch of the OF repository corresponds to the most recent release, with a few important differences:  

1. The release includes a simple openFrameworks project generator.
2. This GitHub repository contains code and libs for all the platforms, but the releases are done on a per-platform basis.
3. This GitHub repository has no project files for the different examples. They are generated automatically for each release using a tool in `apps/projectGenerator/`.
4. There are no external dependencies in this repository, you can download them using the download_libs.sh script for each platform in the particular platform folder inside scripts.

If you want to work with the openFrameworks GitHub repository, you need to download the external dependencies and you should use the project generator to create project files for all the code in `examples/`.  To generate the project files with the project generator enable the 'Advanced Options' in the settings tab, then use 'Update Multiple' to update the projects for the `examples/` folder path in the repo.

To set up the project generator submodule within the OF repo, use the command `git submodule init` then `git submodule update` whilst inside the openFrameworks repo.

For more info on working with the Project Generator, for per-platform readmes, and more information, see the [documentation](docs/table_of_contents.md).

## Versioning

openFrameworks uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), although strict adherence will only come into effect at version 1.0.0.
